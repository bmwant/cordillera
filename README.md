A desktop application for visualizing [Massif](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.html) memory profiling data produced by [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/).

Valgrind's Massif tool profiles heap memory usage in your programs, capturing snapshots of memory allocation over time. 
Cordillera takes the `.out` files generated by Massif and transforms them into interactive visualizations, making it easy to identify memory hotspots, 
track allocation patterns, and optimize your application's memory footprint.

## Features

- :desktop_computer: **Cross-platform** - Native builds for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Interactive chart** - Visualize memory consumption over time with zoomable Chart.js graphs
- :deciduous_tree: **Heap tree explorer** - Navigate detailed snapshots with expandable callgraph visualization
- :bar_chart: **Peak analysis** - Summary of peak memory consumption across all allocating functions
- :package: **Export to SVG** - Save charts as vector graphics for reports and documentation
- :zap: **Lightweight** - Built with [Tauri 2.0](https://tauri.app/)

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/bmwant/cordillera/releases) page:

## Usage

1. Run Valgrind Massif on your program:

```bash
valgrind --tool=massif ./your-program
```

2. Open Cordillera and load the generated `massif.out.*` file

3. Explore your memory profile:
   - **Chart tab**: View memory usage timeline, hover for details, zoom to inspect specific periods
   - **Tree tab**: Expand allocation trees to trace memory usage back to source locations
